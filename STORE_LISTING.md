## Detailed Description

### For Chrome Web Store / Edge Add-ons

**PeerBeam - Private Peer-to-Peer Chat for Your Browser**

Chat directly with other browser tabs using secure, peer-to-peer technology. No servers storing your messages. No accounts required. Just pure, direct communication.

**Key Features:**

- **True P2P Communication** - Messages go directly from your browser to theirs using WebRTC. No middleman, no message logs on external servers.

- **End-to-End Encrypted** - All WebRTC connections use DTLS encryption by default. Your conversations stay private.

- **No Account Required** - Just pick a username and start chatting. No sign-ups, no email verification, no passwords.

- **Zero Data Collection** - We don't collect analytics, tracking data, or any personal information. Your username is stored only on your device.

- **Room-Based Chat** - Create or join chat rooms with simple room codes. Share the code with friends to start chatting instantly.

- **Lightweight & Fast** - Minimal footprint, instant connections, no bloat.

**How It Works:**

1. Click the PeerBeam icon in your browser toolbar
2. Enter your display name
3. Create a new room or join an existing one with a room code
4. Share the room code with others
5. Start chatting directly, peer-to-peer!

**Privacy First:**
PeerBeam is built with privacy as the core principle. Messages are never stored on any server. The only external service used is Google's STUN server, which only helps establish the initial connection - no message content ever passes through it.

**Perfect For:**
- Quick, private conversations
- Team communication without third-party services
- Users who value privacy and simplicity
- Anyone tired of creating accounts for everything

**Open Source:**
PeerBeam is transparent about how it works. Check out our privacy policy for complete details on our data practices.
